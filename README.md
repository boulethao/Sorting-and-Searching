# Sorting-and-Searching
Highlights on sorting and search algorithms

#### Quick sort
1. Mechanics
    - Divide and conquer
    - Partition around a pivot
    - Sorting during partitioning (divide)
2. Time complexity
    - Worst
    - Average:
    - Best:
3. Pivot choice
    - First/Last element
    - Random element
    - Median of three
    - Median of medians
4. Attributes
    - Parallelizable
    - Extendable to k way distribution
    - Memory access not sequential
5. Others
    - Chosen sorting algorithm for standard libraries
    - Iterative quick sort
    - Quick select: similar quick sort algorithm to find the k<sup>th</sup> smallest (or largest element)
